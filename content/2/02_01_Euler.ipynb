    "Let’s consider a simple 1st order equation: \n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this equation with a computer we need to **discretize** the differences: we\n",

    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that at a point $x_0$, the function $f$ has a value $y_0$. We\n",
    "want to find the approximate value of $y$ in a point $x_1$ close to\n",
    "$x_0$, $x_1=x_0+\\Delta x$, with $\\Delta x$ small. We assume that $f$,\n",
    "the rate of change of $y$, is constant in this interval $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "Therefore we find: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "&& dx \\approx \\Delta x &=&x_1-x_0, \\\\\n",
    "&& dy \\approx \\Delta y &=&y_1-y_0,\\end{eqnarray}$$ with\n",
    "$y_1=y(x_1)=y(x_0+\\Delta x)$. Then we re-write the differential equation in terms of discrete differences as:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}=f(x,y)$$ or \n",
    "$$\\Delta y = f(x,y)\\Delta x$$\n",
    "and approximate the value of $y_1$ as\n",
    "$$y_1=y_0+f(x_0,y_0)(x_1-x_0)$$ We can generalize this formula to find\n",
    "the value of $y$ at $x_2=x_1+\\Delta x$ as\n",
    "$$y_{2}=y_1+f(x_1,y_1)\\Delta x,$$ or in the general case:\n",
    "$$y_{n+1}=y_n+f(x_n,y_n)\\Delta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good approximation as long as $\\Delta x$ is “small”. What is\n",
    "small? Depends on the problem, but it is basically defined by the “rate\n",
    "of change”, or “smoothness” of $f$. $f(x)$ has to behave smoothly and\n",
    "without rapid variations in the interval $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that Euler’s method is equivalent to a 1st order Taylor expansion\n",
    "about the point $x_0$. The “local error” calculating $x_1$ is then\n",
    "$O(\\Delta x^2)$. If we use the method $N$ times to calculate $N$\n",
    "consecutive points, the propagated “global” error will be\n",
    "$NO(\\Delta x^2)/X\\approx O(\\Delta \n",
    "x)$, where $X=N\\Delta x$. This error decreases linearly with decreasing step, so we need to\n",
    "halve the step size to reduce the error by half. The numerical work for\n",
    "each step consists of a single evaluation of $f$."
